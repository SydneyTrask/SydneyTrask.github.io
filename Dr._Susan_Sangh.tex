Right now, we have some exciting neural data from the PFC collected in
freely behaving rats during our safety learning task. At the single
neuron level, we are seeing many neurons in the infralimbic cortex
responding to a learned safety cue while fear behavior is being
suppressed.

I feel like I have been overall quite lucky to have had really
supportive mentors, both male and female, throughout my career. However,
when I got my faculty position and was the `boss' of the lab and
classroom, it appeared to me I was not getting the same level of respect
from students, in the classroom and in the lab, as a new male PI would.
In that vein, are there any benefits to being a woman in this field?

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{What advice would you give

That would be 2009, when I finished my first postdoc and was starting my
second postdoc. The thing I did right was take a chance and start my
line of research on safety learning. The advice I would give myself
would probably be ``ok, breathe, relax, it'll all be fine''. I was too
stressed about getting the faculty position. I obviously succeeded in
getting one, but life would have been fine if I didn't.

I don't like pie. I do like chocolate cake though.

Fall, I go gaga over colorful fall foliage.

Being outside, taking photos and playing with my dog. I don't live near
mountains anymore but a hike in the mountains would be a perfect
Saturday.

Over the years, it has become to me an interactive and supportive
community filled with other learning nerds.

Dr.~Mihaela Iordonova from Concordia in Montreal. She is one of the
sharpest women in learning I know.
